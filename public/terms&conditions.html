Our agreement</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">These booking conditions, our privacy policy, and any other written information we brought to your attention before we confirmed your booking form the basis of your contract with us for the arrangements making up your booking. Please read all that information carefully as it sets out the scope of our agreement as well as our respective rights and obligations. By making a booking, you agree to be bound by all of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We act as an agent for suppliers in respect of all bookings we take and/or make on your behalf and your contract will be with the supplier of the arrangements in question. When making your booking we will arrange for you to enter into a contract with the applicable supplier(s) of the arrangements. The suppliers whose services make up your arrangements make those supplies under their terms and conditions which will also form part of your agreement with us. Thus, your booking with us is subject to these terms and conditions and the specific booking conditions of the relevant supplier(s) you contract with and you are advised to read both carefully before booking. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier’s liability to you, usually per applicable International Conventions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key terms to our agreement:</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You will enter into binding contracts with applicable suppliers when we confirm to you that your programme is booked in a confirmation email. If you then cancel your arrangements, you will be required to pay cancellation charges. Initially, this will be the deposit you paid to secure your arrangements, but after you’ve paid the balance of the price cancellation charges will be applicable as stated in clause 6;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">You can make changes to your confirmed arrangements in certain circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The supplier of your arrangements may make changes to and cancel your confirmed arrangements;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Some of our arrangements may involve physical exertion and/or risk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We are responsible for making sure your confirmed arrangements are not performed negligently but there are some limits on and exceptions to this, and you must always report any dissatisfaction to us as soon as you can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you pay your deposit, you agree that we may automatically collect the final balance and any final adjustment for your share of the arrangements from the last card that you used with us.

However, occasional changes and errors do arise and we reserve the right to correct them in such circumstances. You must check the current price and all other information relating to the arrangements that you wish to book before your booking is confirmed. We will not be liable for booking errors that are attributable to you or which are caused by unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances as described in clause 8.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">All website descriptions are made in good faith and every care is taken to ensure their accuracy. However, errors may occasionally occur. We cannot accept any liability for any errors or omissions except where these have arisen due to our negligence or that of any of our employees (as long as they were acting in the course of their employment at the time). While we provide product images to give a close representation of the product, we reserve the right to use images that may not be of the exact product itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Please note: most daytime activities take place at outdoor activity centers, which by their nature are not usually located in city centers/urban areas. Breaks/events advertised and sold by us as taking place in or to any particular city/town may include activities in locations that we consider to be within a reasonable distance from your accommodation and/or that city/town. As a general guide, we would consider a reasonable distance to be approximately 50km although this may be more for some exclusive activities. We provide you with location details of the activities and venues in your itinerary and it is your responsibility to ensure that you have adequate time and suitable transport to get between your chosen activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Group Organiser</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Whether you choose to have the Organizer make all payments on behalf of your party or if you choose to pay individually, you accept that the Organizer has the authority to deal with us on your behalf but we may act on the instructions of individual members of the party if we consider it necessary. If, for any reason, there is a change in the Organizer, you should notify us in writing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">immediately. The Organizer must be authorized to make the booking on the basis of these terms and conditions by all persons on the booking and their parent or guardian for all party members who are under 18 when the booking is made. We can only accept bookings if the Organizer is a minimum of 18 years old. Each individual member of the party will be liable for payment of amounts due in relation to their individual booking. Additionally (at our option) the Organizer will be liable for payment of all amounts due in relation to the whole booking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Making a Booking</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you ask us to make your booking we will first confirm that all elements of your booking are available. Once all elements are confirmed by the applicable suppliers we will send you a final price for the entire programme and ask the Organizer to make a non-refundable deposit or full payment, as applicable. At this point, we will then confirm your booking by sending you a confirmation email at which point a binding contract between you and us will come into existence. Any email, or online notification, confirming that we are holding your booking pending confirmation by a supplier, does not constitute a contract. Once a binding contract is in place, we</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">will indicate the time the Organizer has to invite guests and for them to pay through your dedicated customer’s area subject to the payment terms in the clause below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Please check all details of the programme on receipt of your confirmation email. It may not be possible to make changes to your arrangements later, or those may affect the final price, so you should notify us of any inaccuracies as soon as possible after confirmation. It may harm your rights if you don’t.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 297%;text-align: left;">Payments of Amounts Due Deposit</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you make a booking, the Organizer must pay either an initial non-refundable deposit of 50€, or the full balance of the cost of the arrangements if you are booking within 30 days of the first day the programme is taking place. If you are booking within 30 days of the beginning of the programme, following confirmation of the booking, all invited guests must also pay the full balance of the cost of the arrangements. If guests have agreed to attend the event but have not paid the deposit (or balance) by the deposit due date (or balance due date) they will be automatically canceled from the booking at no charge shortly after the applicable due date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Balance</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The balance of the cost of your arrangements must be paid no less than 30 days prior to the beginning of the programme and will be automatically collected from the card details you last used with us or from the card details you have subsequently updated with us. Please note that if you have paid another guest’s deposit, then you are committed to also pay that guest’s balance and any subsequent adjustment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Should your balance payment be declined you will be invited to update your card details. We will try to automatically deduct the balance from the latest card details you have registered with us. If your final balance has not been paid within 3 days of the balance due date, then we will automatically cancel you from the event and you will forego your non-refundable deposit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adjustments</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There may be circumstances where your itinerary or the party size changes after all group members have paid the balance. This could give rise to an extra cost or refund which we call the “adjustment”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We will automatically attempt to deduct or make a refund to the latest card details you have registered with us for the “adjustment” as soon as possible. We will notify you by email at least 24 hours before we credit or debit your card if an adjustment has arisen. If we are unable to debit</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">your card, we will notify you by email and you will be invited to update your card details to settle the “adjustment”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="2."><h1 style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Insurance</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It is a condition of our agreement that you are covered by adequate insurance for your arrangements. Such insurance as a minimum must cover your losses sustained as a result of a cancellation, medical issues, and repatriation in the event of an accident or illness. You must ensure that the policy you purchase is suitable for your confirmed arrangements including any hazardous activities. Many policies do not cover such activities so you must check the small print before purchasing and if in doubt, check with the insurers that you will be covered. You must also ensure that your insurance covers participation in any hazardous activities which do not form part of your arrangements. If you choose to participate without adequate insurance cover, we will not be liable for any of your losses however arising, in respect of which insurance cover would otherwise have been available.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Special requests</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Special requests relating to your arrangements must be advised to us at the time of booking and confirmed to us in writing. Whilst we will try to arrange your reasonable special requests, we cannot guarantee that they will be fulfilled. If we are able to specifically confirm a special request or requirement on behalf of a supplier, we will do so on our confirmation, but where requests or requirements have not been so confirmed in writing on our confirmation, a failure to meet them will not be a breach of contract.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4."><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Hazards, health disabilities and medical problems</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Some of the activities and events we offer are, by their nature, inherently dangerous and on the day of the event, some suppliers may require you to sign a disclaimer or acknowledgement of the risks involved (copies are available on request). By participating in these events, you assume the inherent risks involved. We cannot be responsible for any injury or loss suffered by you other than as expressly set out in these terms and conditions. You must ensure you have personal travel insurance which covers such activities and events – see clause 2.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Some of the events or activities you may book require a good level of fitness, strength and endurance. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the appropriate level. We will give you general information about whether your arrangements are suitable for persons with reduced mobility but many events are not recommended for those with any disability, illness or infirmity. If you have an existing medical condition, allergies or disability which may affect your arrangements you must let us know the details before you make your booking. If in our reasonable opinion, your chosen arrangements are not suitable for you taking into account your medical condition or disability or you are not being accompanied by someone who can provide all</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">the assistance you may reasonably require where it is reasonable for us to require this we will advise the applicable supplier(s) who can instruct us to refuse to accept the booking. If we find out after you have made the booking that you have an existing medical condition or disability and you are not being accompanied by someone who can provide all the assistance you may reasonably require as referred to above and you have failed to give us this information at the time of booking, we may cancel your booking and impose the cancellation charges as set out in clause 6 where in our reasonable opinion, the confirmed arrangements are not suitable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">The price you pay</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We reserve the right to amend the price of unsold arrangements at any time and correct errors in the prices of confirmed arrangements. We will also change the price where there has been a change to the details of the original booking that affects its overall price. Once your arrangements have been confirmed to you in our confirmation email then subject to other clauses in these terms and conditions, the price will not change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="6."><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Changes and cancellations by you</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you wish to make any changes to your arrangements after they have been confirmed, including if you wish to cancel all or some of them, you must inform us in writing as soon as possible. Your notice requesting a change or cancellation will only take effect when it is received in writing by us and will be effective from the date on which we receive it. We can’t guarantee that changes can be met, although we will do our best to assist.
